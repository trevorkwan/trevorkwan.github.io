Identifying the factors that influence people's income is crucial for a fair society. The "Adult Data Set"[5] is such a dataset that records people's income and related variables in the US. It was collected by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. It allows us to predict whether income exceeds \$50K/year based on adult census data. With this dataset, we explore how the recorded variables influence people's income.

In this project, by utilizing generalized linear models (GLM), we want to mainly focus on the following two tasks:
* Build a GLM prediction model to predict adult income.
* Identify key variables that have a large influence over one's income.
