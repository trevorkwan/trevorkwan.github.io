We were tasked with predicting whether or not a sample taker will become a paying customer. To answer this business question, we built a classification model. However, due to limitations in quality of features and number of features provided, our model yielded high recall but low precision. We then pivot towards conducting exploratory feature analysis to help Riversol identify customer features that are most influential to whether or not a sample taker will end up purchasing.
