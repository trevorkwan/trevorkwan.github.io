In this project, I fine-tune a BERT NLP model on the MedNLI dataset using natural language inference text classification in an automated workflow. This project utilizes a Makefile to simplify the execution of various tasks such as data cleaning, hyperparameter optimization, training, evaluation, and prediction.

My work can be found [here](https://github.com/trevorkwan/MedNLI-BERT-Text-Classification).
