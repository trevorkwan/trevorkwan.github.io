Hi, I'm Trevor Kwan and welcome to my personal blog. I started off doing a Bachelors in Psychology, but quickly developed a passion for data science. In the 3 years after my Bachelors, I completed two Master degrees at the University of British Columbia, one in Data Science and one in Statistics. While completing these Master degrees, I self-taught myself all the undergraduate pre-requisite statistics courses necessary to complete statistics courses at the graduate level. I am a fast learner, one that adapts easily to change and am committed to lifelong learning.
