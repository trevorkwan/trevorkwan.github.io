subtitle: My journey in learning.

My name is Trevor Kwan. I started doing a Bachelors in Psychology, but quickly developed a passion for data science. In the 3 years after my Bachelors, I completed two Maseter degrees at the University of British Columbia, one in Data Science and one in Statistics. While completing these Master degrees, I self-taught myself all the undergraduate pre-requisite statistics courses necessary to complete statistics courses at the graduate level. I am a fast learner, one that can adapt easily to change and am committed to lifelong learning.
