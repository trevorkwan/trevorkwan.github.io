### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

## My Story

My name is Trevor Kwan. I started doing a Bachelors in Psychology, but quickly developed a passion for data science. In the 3 years after my Bachelors, I completed two Maseter degrees at the University of British Columbia, one in Data Science and one in Statistics. While completing these Master degrees, I self-taught myself all the undergraduate pre-requisite statistics courses necessary to complete statistics courses at the graduate level.

I am a fast learner, one that can adapt easily to change. committed to lifelong learning.
