Hi, I'm Trevor Kwan. Welcome to my personal blog. 

I started off doing a Bachelors in Psychology, but quickly developed a passion for quantitative/computational analytics. 

In the 3 years after my Bachelors, I completed two Master degrees at the University of British Columbia, one in Data Science and one in Statistics. While completing these Master degrees, I self-taught myself the undergraduate pre-requisite statistics courses necessary to complete statistics courses at the graduate level. 

I am currently employed as an NLP data scientist at the UBC Data Science Institute, advised by Dr. Raymond Ng, where I leverage NLP to improve healthcare systems. 

I am a passionate and curious learner, one that is committed to lifelong learning with a growing heart for the field of mental health.
